# buildSrc
buildSrc is a directory at the project root level which contains build info. We can use this directory to enable kotlin-dsl and write logic related to custom configuration and share them across the project. It was one of the most used approaches in recent days because of its testability.

## Kotlin DSL
Kotlin DSL is built on top of the core language Kotlin. So the syntax would no different from the parent language which gives us the benefit of using Kotlin for development. Kotlin DSL is fully supported in Android Studio.
